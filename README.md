To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites:
   - Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) for local server setup.
   - Ensure PHP and MySQL are installed and running.

2. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital_management_system.git
   cd hospital_management_system

3. Database Setup
    - Open phpMyAdmin ([http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)).
    - Create a new database named `hospital_management`.
    - Import the SQL file (`database/hospital_management.sql`) into the database.

4. Configure Database Connection
    - Open the `config.php` file in the `includes` folder.
    - Update the database credentials:
  
    ```php
    $host = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $database = "hospital_management";

5. Run the Application
   - Move the project folder to the `htdocs` (XAMPP) or `www` (WAMP) directory.
   - Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
   - Open your browser and navigate to:

## ðŸ§© System Architecture Rationale

### Why Two Separate Systems?
This dual-system architecture was strategically designed to:

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Modular Design** | Enables independent updates to hospital or pharmacy components without system-wide downtime |
| **Scalability** | Allows separate scaling of pharmacy inventory management and patient care systems |
| **Flexible Deployment** | Institutions can implement either system standalone or integrated |
| **Integration Showcase** | Demonstrates API-based interoperability between healthcare systems |
